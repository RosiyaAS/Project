**Analyzing and Predicting Seoul’s Bike Rental Patterns with ML**

Abstract: This project focuses on predicting bike rental demand using the Seoul Bike Sharing dataset. The data underwent preprocessing steps including handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, and addressing skewness. Feature selection was done using the SelectKBest algorithm, followed by scaling and model training. Multiple machine learning models were evaluated including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and SVR. Random Forest emerged as the best model with the highest R² score.

Objective: To build a predictive model that accurately forecasts bike rental counts based on weather and seasonal features. To compare different regression algorithms and determine the most effective one.

Project Info: This project is a machine learning-based analysis of Seoul's hourly bike rental data. The goal is to assist city planners and bike-sharing services in understanding demand patterns and improving resource allocation. The approach involves feature engineering, model evaluation, and performance comparison using Python and libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
